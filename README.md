# dotfiles

My *very* opinionated configuration files. Handcrafted with ❤️, to indulge my
OCD

Include configuration for my most used command line tools: neovim, fish-shell &
Karabiner Elements for Mac. Also, my own colour scheme for iTerm2 that I call
Dark Fantasy for its high contrast ratio, crafted with a focus on clarity and
legibility in different environments.
